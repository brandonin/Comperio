This web app was made by Brandon In using PHP, MySQL and CodeIgniter as our MVC framework.

Comperio is a web application made during HackingEDU, a 36-hour hackathon that attempts to solve problems within education using a technical angle. I created Comperio in the hopes of targeting individuals in low-income inner-city communities to provide a means of exposing children to topics such as: science, math, art, history, etc. A huge problem in these societies is that many individuals are not exposed to these topics at an early enough age, which is reflective on their attention to these subjects within the education system. The goal of this app was to touch upon these issues and figure out a scalable way to create an app that grows and has content that reflects the age and abilities of each individual.
